A function is a block of code that performs a specific task.

Suppose, you need to create a program to create a circle and color it. You can create two functions to solve this problem:
1. create a circle function
2. create a color function
Dividing a complex problem into smaller chunks makes our program easy to understand and reuse.

There are two types of function in C programming:

1. Standard library functions (scanf,printf etc.)
2. User-defined functions (4 types)
    2.1: No Argument Passed and No Return Value.
    2.2: No Arguments Passed But Returns a Value.
    2.3: Argument Passed But No Return Value.
    2.4: Argument Passed and Returns a Value.
